- ‚úÖ Try removing and re-adding the extension

- ‚úÖ Ensure email has at least one date and time pattern

#### Build Errors

# If Vite not recognized:
npx vite build
```

#### Content Script Not Working
- ‚úÖ Refresh Gmail page after loading extension
- ‚úÖ Check Chrome Developer Tools ‚Üí Console for errors
- ‚úÖ Verify manifest.json permissions are correct

## üìä How Detection Works

### Pattern Matching Score System
- **Event Keywords**: meeting (+3), appointment (+3), call (+2), etc.
- **Time Patterns**: "2:00 PM" (+2), "morning" (+1)
- **Date Patterns**: "January 15" (+2), "tomorrow" (+2)
- **Context Clues**: "join us" (+1), "location" (+1)
- **Threshold**: Requires score ‚â• 4 to show popup

### Smart Extraction
- **Title**: Extracted from subject line or first meaningful sentence
- **Date**: Supports multiple formats (MM/DD/YYYY, "next Monday", etc.)
- **Time**: 12/24-hour formats, relative times
- **Location**: Addresses, room numbers, online meeting links
- **Attendees**: Email addresses found in content

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All email analysis happens in your browser
- **No Data Storage**: Email content is not stored or transmitted
- **Google APIs Only**: Only communicates with Google Calendar API
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests necessary Gmail and Calendar access

## üé® Customization

### Detection Sensitivity
- **Low**: Only very clear events (meetings with explicit date/time)
- **Medium**: Balanced detection (recommended)
- **High**: More aggressive detection (may have false positives)

### UI Themes
The extension automatically adapts to your system's color scheme and supports:
- High contrast mode
- Reduced motion preferences
- Mobile/responsive design

## üìà Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** with various email types
2. **Adjust settings** based on your preferences
3. **Report issues** if you find any problems
4. **Enjoy** seamless calendar integration!
